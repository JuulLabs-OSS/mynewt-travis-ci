This directory contains two .js files that have the code required to run
both runkit endpoints. To avoid making github tokens visible, the travis
script sends data to runkit.com, which is responsible for doing the GH API
calls. To setup:

`github-commenter.js` expects a `GITHUB_BOT_TOKEN` env variable to be set
up in runkit.com. This can be any user, and a new user `apache-mynewt-bot`
was created to be used here.

`github-status-reporter.js` expects a `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` var which has
to be a token with permissions to write on the repository so a commiter
has to create it.

The auto-generated tokens when connecting runkit<->github don't seem to
work, so create new keys for both above under github and configure them
in runkit.com.
